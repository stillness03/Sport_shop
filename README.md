# Django project: Sports Store

This project is a fully functional website built using Django. It includes user system, shopping cart, checkout, payment system with Stripe api, map and calorie calculator.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Applications

- **`main`** - homepage, basic navigation, templates  
- **`cart`** - shopping cart, add/remove products  
- **`users`** - registration, authorization, user profile  
- **`orders`** - ordering and order history  
- **`payment`** - payment processing  
- **`calculator`** - client calorie calculator
- **`google_maps`** - OpenStreetMap integration via JavaScript  

## DB I have implemented with PostgreSQL.

## All necessary libraries are in requirements.txt file (I will upload it later).

## Deployment is suspended for now, because I don't see the point at this time to spend money for (pet project) and that people could poke buttons on the site. In the future I will improve this site, add new functionality, but for now I decided to stop at this stage.
